## MY INTERESTS

### Design
In design I look for ***new art styles*** that are enabled by new technology and software tools. I also focus on ***digital design*** because it's challenging and complex work. Then I'm very interested in ***character and game design*** because it is not only about creating nice visual but also personality, mechanics, stories and so on.
### Fantasy/Sci–fi
I grew up on fantasy books, tv shows and games. I think it is also empowering my creativity and thinking outside of the box. That is why I like ***gaming, reading, board games, movies and tv shows*** with something more than you see in real life.
### Drawing
Drawing is definitely part of my life and my work. Usualy when I'm listening something and I get bored and have a piece of paper I start to sketch.
### Cycling
Ii is my favorite exercise activity, because you can observe and also you are not staying in one place.
